## Unit 10 OOP Homework: Template Engine - Employee Summary

The purpose of this project is to build a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays the collected details. This team generator command line application  prompts the user for information about the team manager and the team members. This is completely a Test-driven development(TDD) where requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the code is improved so that the tests pass.
